# WeightTracker
Project 2


## Description

We built this app to help the average user keep track of their weight. 

We built this project to create a place for the user to review....

## Usage

City-Scan was developed with an easy user interface. The home page presents the user with a description, recommendation, and several testimonials.   


input field: "Enter a City," and a dropdown-menu: "Choose a State." Upon hitting the "Search" button, they are redirected to a results page with the populated information with the state's COVID data on one side and the city's quality of life data on the other. A search bar is at the top of the results page to search again along with a link to find the closest vaccine.
