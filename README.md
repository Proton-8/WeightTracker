# WeightTracker
Class Project 2


## Description

We built this app to help the average user keep track of their weight. This website will provide the ability to input their daily weight and allow them to display their daily progress on a table or graph and inspire me to keep going.  They will also have the option to share my progress with my friends or my doctor.
  

## Usage

The Home Page will present the user with information about the site and the ability to login. The login page will allow returning users to log in with their email and password or create a new user account.
